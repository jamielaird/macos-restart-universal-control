# macOS Restart Universal Control

This repository contains an AppleScript designed to restart Universal Control on macOS. 

## Why?

Universal Control is an incredibly useful feature, but it is prone to dropping out. This script provides a quick and easy way to restart it without needing to do it manually.

## Usage

1. Download the script file `restart-universal-control.scpt`
1. Open it in Apple's Script Editor app
1. File > Export to save it as an Application
1. On first run, you will need to grant the app permission to control your computer. This is required to allow the app to restart Universal Control. You find this setting in `System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility` then toggle the app's name.

## Alternatives

If you know a CLI-friendly way to do this, please suggest! I tried a few solutions on the web, but the method via System Settings seems to be the only reliable option.
